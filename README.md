# Digital Twin Blue Boat

## Introduction

The following repository offers a baseline concept for research purposes. The concept follows the Digital Twin concept, where a virtual representation of BlueBoat is simulated (offline programming).
Once the motion is satisfied, the program can be deployed to a real vehicle. During the motion of the real boat, it is possible to check the performance of the robot in the simulation and compare the results.

System overview can be presented as follows
