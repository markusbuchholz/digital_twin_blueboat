# Digital Twin Blue Boat

The following repository offers a baseline concept for research purposes. The concept follows the Digital Twin concept, where a virtual representation of BlueBoat is simulated (offline programming). Once the motion is satisfied, the program can be deployed to a real vehicle. During the motion of the real boat, it is possible to check the performance of the robot in the simulation and compare the results.
